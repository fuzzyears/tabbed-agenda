A bare bones and easily customizable tabbed agenda.

I recently joined a new team at work which utilizes some very bloated components. The unused scripts, styles, inconsistent class use, etc. featured in these components makes very hard to customize. Additionally, these are being loaded in a way I am not clear on...Investigating that is a separate project. For now, this will be a quick template that can be copied into new projects and customized as needed.
